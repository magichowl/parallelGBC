LICENSE
This program is free software; see LICENSE.TXT for more details

REQUIREMENTS

* A compiler which supports OpenMP and C++11 (GCC is fine)
* A processor which has SSE, if not disable it in the Makefile.rules
* Several processors if you want to use the parallelization (dual or quadcores, etc.)

INSTALLATION
Just execute

# make

and if you have several CPUs, you can use

# make -j<NUM_OF_PROCS>

If you experience any problems, then have a look to the Makefile or 
contact the author

TESTING
