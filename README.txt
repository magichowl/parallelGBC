Parallel Groebner Basis Computation (alpha 0.1)

LICENSE
This program is free software; see LICENSE.TXT for more details

REASON
This program provides an algorithm for parallel groebner basis computation.
If you do not know, what a groebner basis is and what they are for,
you may read on here:

http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Groebner_basis

The code of the project is the result of my master thesis. Documents for
reading will follow in later releases (some translations have to be done...)


REQUIREMENTS
* A compiler which supports OpenMP and C++11 (GCC is fine)
* A processor which has SSE, if not disable it in the Makefile.rules
* Several processors if you want to use the parallelization (dual or quadcores, etc.)

INSTALLATION
Just execute

# make

and if you have several CPUs, you can use

# make -j<NUM_OF_PROCS>

If you experience any problems, then have a look to the Makefile or 
contact the author

TESTING
Compute the degree reverse lexicogrpahic gr√∂bner basis of cyclic-8 with 4 threads

cd test/;
./test/test-f4 ../input/cyclic8.txt 4

USAGE AND EXAMPLE
If you want to use the code for your own project see test/test-f4.C as example
